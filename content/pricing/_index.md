## What am I paying for?

You are paying to support an **independent local developer and student**. You can be sure that Hawaii Bus Plus is focused on values, not on maximizing profit. That’s why we charge our straight-forward, all-inclusive price.

**We stay sustainable by charging a subscription.** Charging a subscription is the only way we make money. We do this so we don’t have to rely on ads, and that means you’ll **never have to see one.**

**We put our users first, not corporate shareholders or investors.** Where you travel is your business. Hawaii Bus Plus protects your privacy, so we **don’t sell your data** to any third-parties — and we promise we never will!
