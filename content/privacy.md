This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and disclose your information and how this information can be accessed and deleted when necessary.

## 3. Scope

Hawaii Bus Plus may contain links to websites, apps, products or services that are operated by third parties, such as Google or Hele-On. This Privacy Policy does not extend to these third parties on which we have no control and for which we cannot be held liable. We encourage you to read about the privacy policies, procedures and practices of those third parties.

## 4. What information we collect from you

We collect and process information from your device in several ways, including:

- We collect contact information (email and name) when you explicitly request to sign up for Hawaii Bus Plus or when signing up for early access.
- We collect your payment information and share it with a payment processor when you explicitly request to sign up for a paid account.
- While we access your location from your device when you grant us explicit permission, this information is stored locally on your device and is not retained nor uploaded to our servers.

## 7. Disclosure to third parties

We do not disclose your information to third parties without your explicit consent except for the following purposes:

- In case you request assistance with the use of Hawaii Bus Plus, we might share such request, including your contact information, with a third party directly involved in the issue (i.e. if you inform us over email that certain transit schedules in the app are outdated, and we forward this message to the applicable transit agency).
- In case we are required to comply with applicable law and regulations and lawful requests or orders or if it is otherwise permitted by law (i.e., protect and defend our rights, situation that threatens life, health or safety, etc.).

We also disclose anonymous and aggregate information to certain third parties for research, product development or other business purposes. For instance, we may share information with transit agencies to help them analyze and improve their services.

## 7.1 Third party software/service

While using Hawaii Bus Plus, we may be using third party software and/or service for various needs, inter alia, in order to collect and/or process the information detailed herein (the "Third Party Service Provider"). These third party services include the usage of Software Development Kits (“SDKs”) from the following companies and for the following purposes:

- Google Maps SDK, which is used to show an interactive map and street view.
- Get Insights SDK, which is used for product analysis.
- Stripe SDK, which is used for payment processing.
- Netlify Identity SDK, which is used to store your user account.
- Mailchimp, which is used for sending out promotional emails.

Note that these are independent software and/or service providers and we do not take any liability about the information collection policies of these providers, or about any kind of issue, legal or otherwise, relating thereto.

We may also provide additional transit-related services, including on-demand transit services, provided by our third party operational service partners (as they may evolve from time to time at our discretion). Such third party providers are subject to their respective terms of use and privacy policies.

## 8. Security Safeguards

We are committed to securing your information and we take reasonable physical, organizational and technical measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction.

These safeguards include, but are not limited to:

- Storage on secure servers;
- Encryption of the communication channels;
- Limited access to employees and contractors on a “need-to-know” basis.

Although we take great efforts to protect your information, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches nor be immune from any wrongdoings or malfunctions.

## 9. Retention period

We will retain your information as long as you use Hawaii Bus Plus and for a reasonable time thereafter.

## 10. Right to access and removal

We store your information on servers located in the USA.
